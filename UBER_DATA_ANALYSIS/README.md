# Uber Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data using Power BI. The data was preprocessed in Python before being imported into Power BI for transformation, analysis, and visualization. Key insights were derived by adding relevant columns and performing data transformations to understand ride trends, fare distribution, and customer ratings.

## Business Problem

Uber operates in a highly competitive ride-sharing market where understanding user behavior, pricing trends, and customer satisfaction is crucial. The company needs insights into ride patterns, fare variations, and driver performance to improve service quality and optimize pricing. By analyzing ride data, Uber can identify key trends, predict future demand, and enhance decision-making to ensure efficient resource allocation and better customer experiences.

## Objectives

- Analyze Uber ride patterns to understand demand trends.
- Identify key factors influencing fare amounts.
- Examine the impact of ride distance on revenue.
- Study customer ratings and their relation to ride performance.
- Forecast future ride demand using historical data.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removing inconsistencies and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visual Analysis:** Interactive dashboards showing ride patterns and trends.
- **Fare and Distance Analysis:** Understanding how fares vary by vehicle type and distance.
- **Passenger Insights:** Tracking passenger count trends over time.
- **Rating Analysis:** Evaluating driver ratings and their impact on fares.
- **Forecasting:** Using historical data to predict future ride demand.

## Key Insights

1. **Vehicle Type Distribution:**

   - UberGo and UberX are the most frequently used vehicle types.
   - UberSUV and UberXL have a lower ride count but contribute significantly to fare amounts.

2. **Fare Analysis:**

   - UberSUV generates the highest fare revenue.
   - Long-distance rides contribute 17.4% of total rides but significantly impact overall revenue.

3. **Passenger Trends:**

   - The total number of passengers varies across months, indicating seasonality in ride demand.
   - Most rides have 1-2 passengers, suggesting a preference for solo or duo rides.

4. **Driver Rating Analysis:**

   - 70% of the ratings fall into the "Good" category.
   - Higher-rated rides tend to have a higher fare amount.

5. **Forecasting and Trends:**

   - Analysis over months suggests potential ride demand fluctuations.
   - Future forecasting helps predict peak times for Uber rides, allowing better driver allocation.

## How to Use the Analysis

1. **Open Power BI** and load the dataset.
2. **Navigate through dashboards** to explore trends, fare analysis, and ratings.
3. **Use filters** to analyze specific time periods, vehicle types, and distances.
4. **Leverage forecasting visuals** to predict future demand.
5. **Export insights** for business decision-making.

## Data Preprocessing Statement

- The data was **cleaned in Python** to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
- The **cleaned version** was then imported into **Power BI**, where additional transformations were performed.
- New columns were added to enhance analysis, including distance categorization and rating categorization.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with live Uber API** to fetch real-time ride data.
- **More advanced machine learning models** for accurate forecasting.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (for data cleaning and preprocessing)
- **Power BI** (for data transformation, visualization, and forecasting)
